This is the WAY! This page is mainly written for OWN PURPOSES. 
Hopefully, it will be helpful in the future. 
It is based on "Google There, Google Here, Try That, Try This, Then Ask." 
A.K.A. "Google Sana / Google Sini". 
Whether this is PLAGIARY or RESEARCH, 
there has never been a claim that this is an original work, 
nor is it necessarily the best solution, 
and not for Scopus consumption :). 
You might provide feedback on alternative ideas.
